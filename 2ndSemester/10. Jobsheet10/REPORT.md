# Labs #10 STACK

## 10.1 Assignment Submission

The lab is implemented in Students27.java, StudentAssignmentStack27.java, and StudentDemo27.java

**Questions:**
1. A stack is used because it follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior, matching how assignments are graded the most recent one is processed first. A queue would reverse this logic (FIFO), which isnâ€™t suitable here.
2. **push()** adds a new student to the top of the stack, while **pop()** removes and returns the top student. In this program, push() is used when a student submits an assignment, and pop() when it's being graded.
3. Checking !isFull() before push() avoids exceeding the stack size. Without it, the program might throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

5. first i add a new menu:

    then i add a new method in StudentAssigmentStack27.java

    then i call the methodon case 5 in StudentDemo27.java menu

6. because top is always checking the newest data we canjust
    public int countAssignments() {
        return top + 1;
    }

7. Stacks are ideal for reversing order processing (LIFO).
    Real-world example: Undo feature in text editors the last action is undone first.


## 10.2 Convert Assignment Grade to Binary

The lab is implemented in Students27.java, StudentAssignmentStack27.java, StudentDemo27.java, and ConversionStack27.java

**Questions:**
1. convertToBinary() converts an integer grade to binary using a stack:
    It repeatedly divides the grade by 2 and pushes the remainder.
    Then, it pops all remainders to build the binary string in correct order.
2. Changing the loop to while (grade != 0) has no effect because it's logically the same as grade > 0.
    But:
        If grade == 0, the loop is skipped and returns an empty string, which is incorrect.
        Solution: Handle grade == 0 case separately by returning "0".
